## 🚨 Blockers to Watch

### Potential Blockers
1. **PortPro API Documentation** - May need to request from PortPro
2. **Terminal Data** - May need to source from eModal/CargoSmart
3. **Clearinghouse Integration** - Requires FMCSA account setup
4. **A2P 10DLC SMS** - Requires carrier approval (Twilio/Telnyx)

### Mitigations
1. **PortPro**: Use Perplexity MCP for research; contact PortPro support
2. **Terminal Data**: Seed with GA/FL ports first; expand later
3. **Clearinghouse**: Manual process for beta; automate in Phase 3
4. **A2P SMS**: Use Twilio's pre-approved templates for beta
