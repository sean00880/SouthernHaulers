## Implementation Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Import Registry in Existing Components**

   // Replace hardcoded data with registry imports
   import { PORTS } from '@/data/ports';
   import { SERVICES } from '@/data/services';
   ```

2. **Refactor Homepage**
   - Use `getFeaturedStats()` for statistics section
   - Use `getFeaturedTestimonials()` for testimonials
   - Use `getFeaturedFaqs()` for FAQ section
   - Use `PORTS` for port coverage section

3. **Create Dynamic Service Pages**
   ```typescript
   // app/services/[slug]/page.tsx
   import { getServiceBySlug } from '@/data/services';
   ```

4. **Build Location Pages**
   ```typescript
   // app/locations/[id]/page.tsx
   import { getLocationById } from '@/data/locations';
   ```

5. **Implement Search**
   ```typescript
   import { RegistryUtils } from '@/data/registry';
   const results = RegistryUtils.search(query);
   ```

### SEO Enhancement

**Structured Data**: Use registry for Schema.org markup
```typescript
import { FAQS } from '@/data/faqs';

// Generate FAQPage schema
const schema = {
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": FAQS.map(faq => ({
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": faq.question,
    "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": faq.answer }
  }))
};
```

**Dynamic Meta Tags**: Generate from registry data
```typescript
import { getServiceBySlug } from '@/data/services';

export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const service = getServiceBySlug(params.slug);
  return {
    title: `${service.name} | Southern Haulers`,
    description: service.description,
  };
}
```

1. Open appropriate registry file
2. Copy existing entry as template
3. Fill in new data
4. Save and deploy
5. Content appears everywhere automatically

**Updating Existing Content**:
1. Find entry by ID
