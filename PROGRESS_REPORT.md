// apps/web/src/components/sections/hero-section.tsx
'use client';

import Image from 'next/image';
import { ArrowRight } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { LiveTracking } from '@/components/features/live-tracking';

export function HeroSection() {
  return (
    <section className="section-full hero-gradient relative overflow-hidden">
      {/* Grid overlay */}
      <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-grid-pattern opacity-30" />
      
      {/* Gradient overlay for depth */}
      <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-transparent via-transparent to-background/80" />

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

### Key Development Principles

1. **Use the Architecture**: Follow patterns in ARCHITECTURE.md
2. **Leverage Registries**: Always pull data from registries, never hardcode
3. **Mobile First**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
4. **Performance**: Use Next.js Image, lazy loading, code splitting
5. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, keyboard nav, ARIA labels
6. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript typing throughout
