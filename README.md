# Southern Haulers – SOTA Logistics Platform

Southern Haulers aims to build the most advanced drayage and logistics platform in the United States.
This repository contains a monorepo setup with placeholders and scaffolding for a Next.js based
application that will grow into a comprehensive transportation management system (TMS), client portal,
driver app, enterprise hiring portal, proprietary quote CRM, and more.

## Key Features (planned)

- **Premium marketing site** with a modular section library and programmatic state/city pages.
- **Client portal** providing real‑time visibility of shipments, documents, invoices and analytics.
- **Admin dashboard** for dispatch, appointment management, billing, exceptions and analytics.
- **Driver PWA** with offline support for load assignments, status updates and document uploads.
- **Enterprise hiring portal** for lease‑on partners with compliance checklists (DOT/MC, COI, TWIC, W‑9,
  Clearinghouse, etc.) and truth‑in‑leasing documents.
- **Proprietary Quote CRM (CPQ)** for managing quotes, rate cards and pipeline stages.
- **AI recruiting engine** that ingests leads from Meta and other sources, screens candidates via SMS,
  schedules interviews and maintains A2P/EEOC compliance.
- **PortPro integration** as a feature‑flagged module with token management, webhooks and data mapping.
- **Agentic operations** including appointment scheduling, exception handling and demurrage alerts.
- **Supabase/PostGIS/pgvector** based data layer with row level security and real‑time updates.
- **WorkOS authentication** for enterprise SSO and directory sync.

The current state of the repository is a skeleton intended to bootstrap development. It includes a
simple landing page with a neon truck hero image, placeholder pages for each portal, a basic design
system, and documentation.
