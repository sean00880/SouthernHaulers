# Vercel Deployment Fixes

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue**: 404 NOT_FOUND error on deployed Vercel site

## Problem Summary

After successfully pushing the Southern Haulers codebase to GitHub and connecting to Vercel, the build completed successfully but the deployed site at `https://southern-haulers.vercel.app/` returned a 404 error.

## Root Cause

Vercel couldn't locate the Next.js app because:
1. The project is a monorepo with the web app in `apps/web/`
2. Vercel's auto-detection doesn't work well with this structure without explicit configuration
3. Missing `postcss.config.js` for Tailwind CSS compilation

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced vercel.json (Commit: bf89a2b)

Created explicit monorepo configuration:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "buildCommand": "cd apps/web && npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/web/.next",
  "installCommand": "npm install --prefix apps/web",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "ignoreCommand": "git diff HEAD^ HEAD --quiet ."
}
```

**What this does**:
- `buildCommand`: Navigates to apps/web and runs the Next.js build
- `outputDirectory`: Points Vercel to the correct .next output directory
- `installCommand`: Installs dependencies in the apps/web directory
- `framework`: Explicitly declares this is a Next.js project
- `ignoreCommand`: Optimizes builds by checking for actual changes

### 2. Added postcss.config.js (Commit: f711bce)

Created `apps/web/postcss.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

**Why this was needed**:
- Tailwind CSS requires PostCSS to process utility classes
- Without this file, Tailwind styles wouldn't compile during the build
- Next.js expects this configuration at the app root

### 3. Verified Monorepo Structure

Confirmed all required files are present:
- ✅ `apps/web/next.config.js` - Next.js configuration
- ✅ `apps/web/tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- ✅ `apps/web/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- ✅ `apps/web/postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration (newly added)
- ✅ All transpilePackages exist in `packages/`:
  - `packages/domain/`
  - `packages/db/`
  - `packages/auth/`
  - `packages/ui/`

## Previous Fixes (Leading to This Point)

### Build Error 1: Missing packageManager
- **Error**: Turborepo couldn't resolve workspaces
- **Fix**: Added `"packageManager": "npm@10.2.4"` to root `package.json`
- **Commit**: 013b3c4

### Build Error 2: Pipeline vs Tasks
- **Error**: Turborepo 2.x uses "tasks" instead of "pipeline"
- **Fix**: Renamed "pipeline" to "tasks" in `turbo.json`
- **Commit**: 71150ef

### Build Error 3: Missing devDependencies
- **Error**: Missing TypeScript and Tailwind dependencies
- **Fix**: Added devDependencies to `apps/web/package.json`
- **Commit**: 3511c54

## Deployment Status

### Current Status
The following commits have been pushed to GitHub and should trigger a new Vercel deployment:
1. bf89a2b - Enhanced vercel.json with monorepo configuration
2. f711bce - Added postcss.config.js for Tailwind CSS

### Expected Outcome
Vercel should now:
1. ✅ Detect the Next.js framework correctly
2. ✅ Install dependencies in `apps/web/`
3. ✅ Compile Tailwind CSS styles via PostCSS
4. ✅ Build the Next.js app in `apps/web/`
5. ✅ Deploy the `.next/` directory
6. ✅ Serve the Southern Haulers landing page at `https://southern-haulers.vercel.app/`

### Verification Steps

Once Vercel completes the deployment (triggered by the latest commits):

1. **Check Build Logs**:
   - Navigate to Vercel dashboard
   - Confirm build completes without errors
   - Verify it's using the new vercel.json configuration

2. **Test Deployed Site**:
   - Visit `https://southern-haulers.vercel.app/`
   - Should see the Southern Haulers landing page (not 404)
   - Test navigation to service pages:
     - `/services/drayage`
     - `/services/agricultural`
     - `/services/warehousing`
     - `/services/refrigerated`
     - `/about/safety`

3. **Check SEO Elements**:
   - View page source
   - Verify JSON-LD structured data is present
   - Confirm Open Graph meta tags are rendered

## Alternative Configuration (If Still 404)

If the 404 persists after the above fixes, configure via Vercel UI:

1. Go to Project Settings → General
2. Set **Root Directory** to `apps/web`
3. Set **Framework Preset** to `Next.js`
4. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
5. **Output Directory**: `.next`
6. **Install Command**: `npm install`

Then delete `vercel.json` from the repository and redeploy.

## Files Modified

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Vercel deployment** to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
2. **Test the deployed site** at https://southern-haulers.vercel.app/
3. **If successful**:
   - Run Lighthouse audits
   - Test all service page links
   - Validate structured data with Google Rich Results Test
   - Submit sitemap to Google Search Console

4. **If still 404**:
   - Try the alternative UI configuration method
   - Or reach out with the latest Vercel build logs
