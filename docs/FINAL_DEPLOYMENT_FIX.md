# Final Deployment Fix - Output Directory

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Commit**: ae7f5f4

## Problem Summary

All apps built successfully via Turborepo, but Vercel failed with:

```
Error: The file "/vercel/path0/.next/routes-manifest.json" couldn't be found.
Learn More: https://err.sh/vercel/vercel/now-next-routes-manifest
```

## Root Cause

**Mismatch between build location and output location:**

1. **Build Process**: Turborepo runs from the **monorepo root** (`/vercel/path0/`)
2. **Build Output**: Web app builds to `apps/web/.next/`
3. **Vercel Expectation**: Looking for `.next/` at the root (wrong location)

### Why This Happened

After configuring Root Directory to `apps/web` in the Vercel UI, I simplified `vercel.json` to let Vercel handle everything. However, this caused a conflict:

- The **buildCommand** runs from the root via `npm run build` → executes Turborepo
- Turborepo builds all apps, with web app output going to `apps/web/.next/`
- Vercel expected the output at the root `.next/` directory

## Solution

Updated `vercel.json` to explicitly tell Vercel where to find the build output:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/web/.next"
}
```

### How This Works

1. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - Runs from monorepo root
   - Executes `turbo run build` (defined in root package.json)
   - Turborepo builds all apps in parallel

2. **Output Directory**: `apps/web/.next`
   - Tells Vercel the web app artifacts are in `apps/web/.next/`
   - Vercel deploys from this directory

3. **Framework Detection**: Still works correctly
   - Vercel detects Next.js from dependencies in root package.json
   - Uses Next.js 14.2.0 properly

## Build Success Summary

The latest build showed **all apps built successfully**:

### ✅ Web App (Production Site)

## Build Performance

```
Tasks:    4 successful, 4 total
Cached:    4 cached, 4 total
Time:    246ms >>> FULL TURBO
```

**Turborepo cache hit** - All apps were cached and replayed from previous successful builds. This is excellent for CI/CD performance!

## Expected Result

With the output directory configured correctly, Vercel should now:

1. ✅ Run `npm run build` from root
2. ✅ Let Turborepo build all apps
3. ✅ Find the web app output in `apps/web/.next/`
4. ✅ Deploy the web app successfully
5. ✅ Serve the site at https://southern-haulers.vercel.app/

## Verification Steps

Once the deployment completes:

1. **Visit the site**: https://southern-haulers.vercel.app/
   - Should show the Southern Haulers landing page
   - No more 404 errors

2. **Test all pages**:
   - `/` - Landing page with Harris Brokerage integration
   - `/services/drayage` - Drayage service page
   - `/services/agricultural` - Agricultural hauling
   - `/services/warehousing` - Warehousing & transloading
   - `/services/refrigerated` - Refrigerated transport
   - `/about/safety` - Safety & compliance

3. **Check structured data**:
   - View page source
   - Verify JSON-LD schemas are present
   - Test with Google Rich Results Test

4. **Performance audit**:
   - Run Lighthouse
   - Should score well (LCP < 2.5s target)
   - All static pages = excellent performance

## Complete Fix Timeline

### Issues Resolved (In Order)

1. ✅ **GitHub push protection** - Removed API keys
2. ✅ **Missing packageManager** - Added to root package.json
3. ✅ **Turborepo 2.x compatibility** - Renamed pipeline → tasks
4. ✅ **Missing devDependencies** - Added to web app
5. ✅ **Framework detection** - Configured Root Directory in Vercel UI
6. ✅ **Missing PostCSS config** - Created for Tailwind compilation
7. ✅ **TypeScript path aliases** - Fixed @/* to resolve from app root
8. ✅ **Obsolete experimental.appDir** - Removed from all apps
9. ✅ **Output directory mismatch** - Configured in vercel.json (THIS FIX)

## Configuration Summary

### Final vercel.json

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/web/.next"
}
```

### Vercel UI Settings

- **Root Directory**: `apps/web` (configured in UI)
- **Framework**: Auto-detected as Next.js 14.2.0
- **Node.js Version**: 20.x (default)

### Why Both Are Needed

- **Root Directory UI setting**: Affects where Vercel looks for package.json and dependencies
- **outputDirectory in vercel.json**: Tells Vercel where to find build artifacts after Turborepo runs

Together, these settings allow Vercel to:
1. Install dependencies from the root (Turborepo + all apps)
2. Run build from the root (executes Turborepo)
3. Deploy from `apps/web/.next/` (web app output)

- `/docs/BUILD_CONFIGURATION_FIXES.md` - TypeScript and Next.js config fixes

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor deployment** - Check Vercel dashboard for successful completion
2. **Test the site** - Verify all pages load correctly
3. **Run quality checks**:
   - Lighthouse audit
   - Google Rich Results Test
   - Cross-browser testing
4. **Configure domain** (when ready):
   - Point southernhaulers.net to Vercel
   - Update environment variables for production URLs
