# Requirements Introduction (Savannah‑First Rollout)

**Context:** Southern Haulers originates in Savannah, GA, anchoring initial scale to Garden City Terminal (GCT) norms.
- **Gate Reality:** PIN‑based access rather than universal appointment slots; RFID tags required on tractors; defined cut‑offs.
- **Design Implication:** The TMS must support **PIN workflows**, **RFID capture**, and dynamic cut‑off timers with alerting.
- **Driver UX:** Mobile‑first driver PWA with offline capture and scan, aligned to GPA processes and the GPA Trucker app signals (notifications, PIN validity).
- **Scaling Path:** After Savannah hardening, replicate the model to other GPA facilities and then nationally with programmatic city/state surfaces.
