# Terminal Appointments, TMF & PierPass (Contrast by Region)

**West Coast (LA/LB):** OffPeak/TMF via PierPass; appointments generally required at terminals; eModal prevalent for gate booking and fee management.

**Savannah (GCT):** Typically **no universal appointment system**; drivers use **PINs** for container moves; design should prefer PIN expirations/renewal logic and dynamic congestion modeling over rigid slots.

**Product Impact:** Two operating modes—(A) Appointment‑centric (eModal‑style), (B) PIN‑centric (GPA style). The TMS switches per terminal profile.
