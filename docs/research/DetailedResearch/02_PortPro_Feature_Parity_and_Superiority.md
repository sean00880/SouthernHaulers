# PortPro Feature Parity & Superiority Strategy

**Goal:** Deliver a custom/hybrid TMS that can *match and exceed* PortPro APIs and workflows.

**Parity Surface (selected):** Loads, Load Status, Drivers, Trucks/Chassis, Shippers/Consignees, Invoices/Bills, Payments, Webhooks.

**Key Protocols:** OAuth‑like bearer access tokens, 24‑hour access token lifetime, single‑active refresh tokens (≈100‑day validity per the docs).

**Webhooks:** HMAC‑style signature via `X‑Hub‑Signature`, fast 200 ACK, retries, idempotent processing, and DLQ dashboards.

**Superiority Moves:** Event‑driven ingest; mappers with authority‑swap per entity; geo‑aware ETA using PostGIS; vectorized search & matching via pgvector; agentic appointment and exception triage; programmatic SEO & quote acceleration.

**Migration:** Start hybrid (mirror PortPro as SoR for selected objects), then switch authorities once contract tests and reconciliation are green.
