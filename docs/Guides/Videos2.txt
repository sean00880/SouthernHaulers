Here is a summary of the key points from the video: A young man is presenting a business proposal to a client in a video conference. The video features a split screen showing the presenter, the client, and a shared screen displaying various websites and documents. The presenter is outlining a plan to revamp the client's websites and integrate their software systems for better efficiency and profitability. Here's a breakdown of the key points: Business Overview: The client operates two businesses: Harris Brokerage, a 3PL (third-party logistics) company, and Southern Haulers, a trucking company with physical assets. The two companies are sister companies, with Harris Brokerage acting as the broker that tenders loads to Southern Haulers. Current Software: The client is currently using Port TMS, a transportation management system, to manage their loads and generate legal documents like bills of lading and rate confirmations. However, they are planning to switch to Port Pro, a more specialized TMS for drayage, in January. Client's Needs: The client wants to revamp the Southern Haulers website to make it more professional and user-friendly. They also want to build a proprietary CRM (customer relationship management) system to manage their customer data, quotes, and prospects. In the long term, they want to create a driver recruiting application that automates the hiring process and integrates with their TMS and factoring company. Business-Client Communication: The presenter is knowledgeable and well-prepared, as he has already done some research on the client's businesses and software. He is also proactive in suggesting ideas and solutions that align with the client's goals. The client is engaged and interested in the presenter's proposal, as he asks questions and provides feedback throughout the presentation. Plan of Execution: The presenter proposes a phased approach to the project. The first phase would be to revamp the Southern Haulers website and create a driver application. The second phase would be to build the proprietary CRM system. The third phase would be to integrate all the systems and automate the workflows. Master Guide: The presenter has created a master guide for the project, which includes a detailed scope of work, a timeline, a budget, and a list of deliverables. The guide is well-organized and easy to follow, and it provides a clear roadmap for the project. Overall, the video shows a professional and well-thought-out business proposal that is tailored to the client's specific needs. The presenter is an expert in his field, and he has a clear vision for how to help the client achieve their goals. The client is also a savvy business owner who is open to new ideas and willing to invest in technology to improve his operations.

Below is a complete, implementation‑ready analysis of the uploaded proposal video (plus your written summary), with an integration blueprint that begins with Southern Haulers (asset carrier) and then seamlessly extends to Harris Brokerage (3PL). I’ve organized this as (1) what’s in the video; (2) the concrete tools/methods to use; (3) a sequential rollout plan with acceptance criteria; and (4) governance, KPIs, and risk controls.

Assumptions noted
• “Switch to PortPro in January” is interpreted as January 2026; if not, shift dates accordingly.
• Harris Brokerage remains on Port TMS initially while Southern Haulers moves to PortPro (drayage‑first), then we decide whether to run both divisions inside PortPro’s hybrid carrier+broker mode or keep a two‑TMS model with an integration layer. PortPro offers a unified carrier/broker instance option. 
PortPro

1) What the video covers (structured overview)

Format & participants

Split‑screen video conference: presenter, client, shared screen (websites/documents).

Objective: revamp Southern Haulers’ website, stand up a driver recruiting application, build a proprietary CRM for both entities, and integrate with TMS + factoring to reduce manual work and lift margins.

Business context (from the call)

Two sister companies

Harris Brokerage — a 3PL/broker that tenders freight.

Southern Haulers — asset‑based trucking (trucks, drivers). Harris tenders loads to Southern when it makes sense.

Systems

Currently on Port TMS; planning a drayage‑specialized move to PortPro. Port TMS advertises EDI/API and many integration partners (DAT, Truckstop, RMIS, SaferWatch, Triumph Pay, etc.). 
Port TMS

PortPro is drayage‑focused and supports REST API + webhooks (events like load#created) and drayage‑specific automations (auto‑populate container data, dispatch, electronic docs).

Needs articulated

Professional Southern Haulers website (lead gen + drivers).

Driver recruiting application → pre‑screen → background/eligibility checks → DQF artifacts → push to TMS.

Proprietary CRM (customers, prospects, quotes) that hands off to the brokerage and carrier workflows.

Automation & integration: TMS ←→ CRM, factoring, ELD/telematics, container visibility, and EDI/API with shippers/partners.

Execution approach (phased)

Phase 1: Southern Haulers website + driver app.

Phase 2: Proprietary CRM.

Phase 3: System integrations + workflow automation (PortPro, Port TMS, factoring, visibility, compliance).

2) Tools, methodologies, and how they map to your two‑company reality
A. Transportation Management Systems (TMS)

PortPro (Southern Haulers — drayage)

API & Webhooks: OAuth‑style bearer tokens, JSON, production base URL, webhook signatures (X‑Hub‑Signature), and events including load#created, load#info_updated, load#dates_updated, etc. This enables real‑time, event‑driven integrations. 
PortPro API Reference

Drayage features: auto ingestion of container status/ETA/LFD/holds from a container number; order entry automation; dispatch + driver mobile; electronic documentation. These reduce port calls and cut D&D risk. 
PortPro

Port TMS (Harris Brokerage — 3PL)

Public website references EDI & API support and a long list of integration partners (load boards, ELD/tracking, compliance tools like RMIS/SaferWatch, payments Triumph Pay, etc.). That makes it practical to keep Harris on Port TMS while Southern shifts to PortPro, with the integration layer in the middle. 
Port TMS

Decision pattern

Option A (Consolidate later): After stabilizing Southern on PortPro, migrate Harris into PortPro’s hybrid carrier+broker instance to run both under one umbrella with role‑based separation. 
PortPro

Option B (Two‑TMS long‑term): Keep Harris on Port TMS and Southern on PortPro, with event‑driven sync and EDI/API bridges. (This is the least disruptive immediately.)

Recommendation: Start with Option B (lowest change risk), and keep Option A as a 9–12 month consolidation decision once the Southern drayage stack is stable.

B. Driver recruiting & compliance (Phase 1 + Phase 3)

Lead → App → Screen → Onboard → DQF → TMS user

Tenstreet provides an industry‑standard recruiting/HR integration hub with APIs to send/receive applicant data and to consolidate job board intake, CSA/PSP feeds, and more. Integrate your custom driver app to Tenstreet so recruiting can stay best‑of‑breed while you own the front‑end UX.

FMCSA Clearinghouse queries (Drug & Alcohol) have Swagger‑documented APIs; broker/carrier compliance can be embedded into onboarding checklists. 
Drug & Alcohol Clearinghouse

General FMCSA developer APIs (safety/carrier info) use a WebKey token flow; useful for carrier vetting on the brokerage side. 
FMCSA Mobile
+1

ELD/Telematics (for time‑at‑gate, HOS, geofencing, POD triggers)

Motive (KeepTruckin), Samsara, and Geotab all expose mature APIs for HOS logs, ELD events, driver clocks, locations, etc., which we’ll use for status automation (e.g., push 214‑like updates back to Harris). 
Geotab

C. Container visibility (critical for drayage margins)

For port/rail milestones (availability, holds, LFD), integrate a visibility API such as Terminal 49, project44, or FourKites. These platforms offer container‑level events and terminal intelligence that you can pipe into PortPro and your CRM for exception workflows (e.g., detain/demurrage risk). 
FourKites

D. Factoring & settlements

Reality in the market: many factoring integrations for carriers still run SFTP/FTP with PDFs + CSVs (e.g., Triumph, RTS), though some modern providers (e.g., Denim) expose API keys you can embed. Our approach should support both patterns: if API exists, use it; otherwise, batch via SFTP with checksums and retry.

E. EDI/API handshake between Harris ↔ Southern

Model the broker→carrier loop on X12 transactions:

204 (Load Tender) → 990 (Response) → 214 (Status) → 210 (Invoice). Even if you go API‑first between Port TMS and PortPro, use these transaction semantics for clarity, auditability, and shipper compliance. 
SPS Commerce

F. Website/CRM engineering patterns

Site: Southern Haulers public site in Next.js (fast, SEO‑friendly), with forms that post to your integration layer (not directly to TMS).

CRM: Build a lean domain model (Accounts, Contacts, Lanes, Quotes, Opportunities, Loads, Containers, Documents) in Postgres behind a service layer (e.g., NestJS/FastAPI).

Integration layer: Event‑driven (lightweight queue + functions). Idempotency keys and replayable DLQ (dead‑letter queue) to guarantee delivery between systems.

3) Architecture that scales from Southern Haulers → Harris Brokerage

PortPro integration specifics:

Inbound: Create/update loads via REST; subscribe to webhooks (load#created, load#info_updated, etc.) to push status back to Harris and to update CRM & visibility dashboards. 
PortPro API Reference

Drayage enrichment: auto pull ETA/LFD/holds from container number (PortPro feature) and/or supplement with a visibility API to reconcile terminal data. 
PortPro

Port TMS integration specifics:

Use Port TMS’s EDI/API capabilities and partner ecosystem (RMIS/SaferWatch for carrier vetting, DAT/Truckstop for spot procurement, Triumph Pay for settlements) to keep Harris fast on coverage. 
Port TMS

4) Data contracts & mappings (selected)

Rule #1: Every cross‑system object gets a stable external_id and an idempotency key on write operations.

Load (Broker) → Load (Carrier/Drayage)

Keys: broker_load_id ↔ portpro_load_id

Core fields: reference_number, mode=DRAY|FTL|LTL, container_number (if dray), pickup/delivery windows, locations, rate, accessorials, customer, notes.

Status mapping (API or EDI semantics):

Assigned/Accepted (990 Accepted) → load.assigned in PortPro

In‑transit updates (214 events) → webhook‑driven status pushes from PortPro

Delivered → triggers POD capture; documents → factoring batch.

Driver onboarding

Keys: driver_app_id ↔ tenstreet_app_id ↔ portpro_driver_id

States: APPLIED → SCREENING → ELIGIBLE → HIRED → IN_SERVICE

Required artifacts: CDL, MVR/PSP, Clearinghouse query result, I‑9/W‑9, direct deposit, ELD account, DQF packet.

Documents

Store PDFs/images in object storage; put signed URLs in both TMS records.

For factoring: if no API, push invoice PDF + CSV batch via SFTP with hash, batch id, and email confirm.

Port TMS
+1

Carrier onboarding (brokerage): RMIS/SaferWatch checks surfaced in CRM for Harris users. 
Port TMS

Acceptance Criteria

Quote → Tender flow completes end‑to‑end; idempotent retries.

CRM search in <300 ms P95 for core objects.

Phase 3 — Systems integration & automation (Weeks 10–24; overlaps)

Workstreams

PortPro integration

Create loads in PortPro; subscribe to webhooks and update CRM + Harris (status mirrors 214). 
PortPro API Reference

Push ELD events (arrive/ depart geofences) to tighten status latency. 
Developers | Samsara

Docs & IDP

If volumes justify, add OCR/IDP for BOL/POD metadata. Start manual, measure, then automate.

Acceptance Criteria

Harris sees status within 5 minutes of a PortPro event; POD triggers invoicing workflow automatically.

Factoring batch cutover achieves < 24h DSO delta against pre‑project baseline.

6) Security, compliance, and data governance (both companies)

AuthN/Z: Single sign‑on (SSO), RBAC by division (Haulers vs Brokerage).

PII & driver records: Encrypt at rest; least‑privilege for recruiting and HR; DQF retention policy.

API security: HMAC‑verified webhooks for PortPro (X‑Hub‑Signature); secrets in a vault; network allow‑lists. 
PortPro API Reference

Audit: immutable event log of tenders, accept/declines, status updates, invoices.

Compliance: FMCSA Clearinghouse queries recorded in the DQF; auditable trail. 
Drug & Alcohol Clearinghouse

7) KPIs & dashboards (what to watch)

Southern Haulers (asset):

Average dray cycle time, % on‑time pulls, demurrage/detention cost per container, driver seat‑fill time, driver application conversion rate.

Webhook event latency (PortPro→CRM→Harris).

Harris Brokerage (3PL):

Quote→tender won rate, time‑to‑cover, load/rep productivity, carrier compliance pass rate.

EDI/API error rate and reprocess time.

8) Risk register & mitigations

9) Concrete “how‑to” playbook (step‑by‑step)

Stand up integration layer (2 weeks)

REST gateway + message queue (SQS/Rabbit).

Secrets vault; observability (structured logs, traces).

Southern website + driver app (parallel, 4 weeks)

Ship the site; POST /drivers/applications → queue → Tenstreet → PortPro (sandbox). 
Tenstreet

CRM MVP (4 weeks)

Accounts/Contacts/Quotes/Lanes; tender button.

PortPro integration (3 weeks)

Create load API; subscribe to webhooks; write event mappers (arrive/depart/delivered). 
PortPro API Reference

Harris Port TMS connector (3 weeks)

Implement JSON 204/990/214/210 semantics; Port TMS calls your /tender endpoint; you reply with acceptance and status (or use Port’s EDI/APIs if preferred).

10) Acceptance tests (sample)

Tender path: Create quote in CRM → click Tender to Harris → Port TMS receives structured JSON (204‑equivalent). Harris Accepts (990) → CRM and Southern PortPro both reflect Assigned within 60s. 
Port TMS

Status path: Driver crosses geofence at terminal → integration posts Departed Pickup to CRM and 214‑equivalent to Harris; POD upload auto‑creates factoring batch with matching invoice CSV. 
Developers | Samsara
+1

Drayage enrichment: Enter a container number in PortPro; ETA/LFD/holds auto‑populate; a Demurrage Risk alert is generated if LFD < 24h. 
PortPro

Why this works for Southern → Harris

Southern needs drayage‑specific automation (container events, dispatch, docs). That’s PortPro’s core, with APIs/webhooks for real‑time sync. 
PortPro API Reference
+1

Harris needs coverage velocity (load boards, carrier compliance) and shippers’ EDI. Port TMS covers EDI/API and partner integrations natively. 
Port TMS

The integration layer ensures you don’t hard‑wire vendors—you own the data and the workflow logic—and you can consolidate later (PortPro hybrid mode) if/when the economics favor it.
