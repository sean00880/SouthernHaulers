# Admin App (Placeholder)

This directory is reserved for a dedicated admin frontend. In future phases, this app will
contain the dispatcher dashboard, appointment manager, exception queues, billing interface
and analytics. For now, these features live in `apps/web/app/admin/page.tsx` as a simple
placeholder.
