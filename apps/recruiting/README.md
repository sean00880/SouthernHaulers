# Recruiting App (Placeholder)

The recruiting app will manage the AI recruiting engine. It will provide dashboards for recruiter
staff to monitor leads, send SMS/Email sequences, schedule interviews and track pipeline stages.

Lead ingestion will be handled via webhooks (e.g. Meta Lead Ads) and stored in the database. SMS
communications will adhere to A2P 10DLC requirements and EEOC guidelines.
