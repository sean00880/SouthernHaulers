# Driver App (Placeholder)

This directory will house the Progressive Web App (PWA) for drivers. The PWA will allow
drivers to view their assigned loads, navigate to pickups and deliveries, upload documents and
view settlement summaries. Offline capabilities and push notifications are planned.

Currently the driver portal is implemented as a static page in `apps/web/app/driver/page.tsx`.
